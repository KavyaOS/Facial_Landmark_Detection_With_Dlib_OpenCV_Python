# Facial_Landmark_Detection_With_Dlib_OpenCV_Python

You may have to install Anaconda, Jupyter notebook, dlib, OpenCV-contrib-python, boost-python modules to run this project.

Special thanks to "https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/03/facial-landmarks-dlib-opencv-python/ " tutorial from which I could learn a lot.
